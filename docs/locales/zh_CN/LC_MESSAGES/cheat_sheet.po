"Technically many of the type annotations shown below are redundant, "
"because mypy can derive them from the type of the expression.  So many of"
" the examples have a dual purpose: show how to write the annotation, and "
"show the inferred types."

"In typical Python code, many functions that can take a list or a dict as "
"an argument only need their argument to be somehow \"list-like\" or "
"\"dict-like\".  A specific meaning of \"list-like\" or \"dict-like\" (or "
"something-else-like) is called a \"duck type\", and several duck types "
"that are common in idiomatic Python are standardized."
